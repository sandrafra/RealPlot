# About app
The application is used to acquire biomedical data. Data is received via a Bluetooth Low Energy connection. 
After connecting to the device, the data is added to the container (QVector). Pressing the Start button adds a widget with a graph where data is displayed in real time. The application also has three functionalities that allow to stop drawing a chart, save plot to a JPG and save the value to a .txt file.
